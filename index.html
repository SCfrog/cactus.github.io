    <h1 class="Pacifico">Cacti</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A Cactus can be very prickly and its spines can get stuck in your skin. Cacti can look numerous ways; Round, tall, flat, sometimes not even a shape at all. Cacti also have flowers.
       They can be orange, pink, red and yellow. Cacti themselves are green. <p>Some Cacti, like Saguaro Cacti, have arms. Cactus arms are like branches on a tree. They do not have legs, but have roots that will grow as deep as three feet into the ground.
<p>To survive, Cacti need sun, but not too much. If they have too much sunlight, they’ll turn a yellow color, almost as if it got sunburned. Cacti also need a lot of air.
During they’re growing season — spring or summer - they need to be watered every one to two weeks. After the growing season, they need to be watered once every three to four weeks.
Cacti also need drainage. Along with that, they need nutrients from the air. Cacti can grow in zones six to nine.
<p>The life cycle of a cactus has five stages. They include germination, vegetive growth, flowering, pollination and fruit formation. <br>In the germination stage, seeds will sprout in a few weeks or months.
<br>In vegetive growth, the cactus will begin to take its shape. <br>In the flowering stage — spring — Cacti open their flowers during the day.
<br>In pollination, pollinators take pollen from flower to flower. <br>In fruit formation, cactus fruit will start to develop, depending on what cactus you have. This starts with a berry covered with spines.
